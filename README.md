# Periodic Table Explorer

## Introduction
I wrote this Periodic Table Explorer application to help chemistry students and enthusiasts explore the elements through an interactive interface. The program provides detailed information about all elements in the periodic table with multilingual support for English, Portuguese, and Norwegian.

## What I Made
I created a complete Python application with a graphical user interface that allows users to:
- Browse all elements in the periodic table
- View element names in three languages (English, Portuguese, Norwegian)
- Search for elements by name, symbol, or atomic number
- View detailed properties for each element with color-coding based on element categories
- Export the entire database to JSON format for use in other applications

The application features a clean, intuitive interface with color-coded element categories to enhance visual learning and make it easy to identify different element types (metals, nonmetals, noble gases, etc.).

## Files in this Project
- `periodic_table_explorer.py` - The main application with GUI interface
- `element_data.py` - The complete element database with multilingual names and properties
- `README.md` - This file with project information

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Install tkinter if it's not already included in your Python installation
3. Run the program with: `python periodic_table_explorer.py`

## Features I Implemented
- **Multilingual Element Names**: All elements have names in English, Portuguese, and Norwegian
- **Comprehensive Properties**: Detailed information including atomic mass, electron configuration, electronegativity, density, melting/boiling points, and discovery information
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Visual identification of element types through consistent color scheme
- **Real-time Search**: Dynamic filtering as you type
- **Data Export**: Save all element data to JSON format
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with proper labels and sections

## Future Improvements
I plan to add more features in the future, such as:
- Additional languages
- Interactive periodic table view
- Isotope information
- Compound builder
- Electron shell visualization

## Technical Details
I built this application using:
- Python 3 with tkinter for the GUI
- JSON for data serialization
- Object-oriented programming principles for maintainable code
